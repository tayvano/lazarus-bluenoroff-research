- > On 4 November 2014, Mr Merlak [CTO of Bitstamp] was contacted by Skype account punk.rock.holiday from IP address (94.185.85.171). The gambit for this phishing attack was to offer Mr Merlak free tickets to Punk Rock Holiday 2015. (Merlak is keen on punk rock and has played in a band.) ... Over a period of approximately five weeks, four more Bitstamp employees received similar highly targeted phishing attacks, each tailored to individual interests. (Bitstamp Incident Report)

### 2015-01-28: 796 - Chinese Exchange Gets 'Goxed' for 1,000 bitcoins
- 796: Not much information available, other than the victim stating that the hacker was putting a lot of effort towards their attack. We have been constantly monitoring the hacking activities on our servers and 3 months back then we took the precautionary step to migrate our servers to a highly secured cloud site. Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt stop the incident from happening last night. In the last 24 hours, our security team worked around the clock to trace back the codes and processes. At this moment, we have a pretty good idea of exactly how they did it. This was not a generalized attack. The hacker‚Äôs strategy was precisely calculated and well targeted to compromise a certain weakness on our server.

### 2018-Jan: Coincheck CEX Hack - $534M
- Hackers stole nearly $530 million in NEM coins from Coincheck, then the leading exchange in Japan. One of Coincheck‚Äôs major security lapses, it admits, is that the exchange kept customer assets in a hot wallet.
- While reported as Laz, it really doesn't look like it...far more like Gox than Laz
- Unidentified assailants stole 523M NEM coins (about $534M) from the exchange's hot wallet
- According to Coincheck, NEM coins are kept on a single-signature hot wallet instead of a more secure multi-signature wallet, and the stolen coins are confirmed to be Coincheck customers.

### 2018-Feb: BitGrail CEX Hack - $120M
- Nano Stolen June 2017, July 2017, October 2017, ???
- Founder hid these thefts, cashed out BTC at the top of the market, and then said oh we got hacked of Nano just like Coincheck in Feb 2018.
- The checks for whether you had a sufficient balance to withdraw were only implemented as client-side JavaScript so I guess anyone could have stolen it
- However it does sound somewhat like the BitThumb Hack that would occur in June of 2018 which was also initially suspected to be an inside job and maybe probably laz?
- Italian investigations do say the actual hackers of Nano are unknown but this is secondary point to how fraudulent the founder was generally.
- Bitgrail was a small Italian exchange trading in lesser-known cryptos, such as Nano (XRB). In February 2018, just as the price of XRB skyrocketed from a few cents to $33, the exchange was hacked. Nano wallets had been targeted with at least 17M coins stolen (the equivalent of around $150M). Many users started to comment that they had noticed issues with the exchange before the attack (significantly lower withdrawal limits and transaction problems). Investigations also revealed that the coins had been stolen from cold wallets, not hot wallets, suggesting an inside job. Investigations have continued over the last few years with Italian police recently accusing the man who owned Bitgrail to be behind the attacks (either directly involved or was aware/took no action to prevent further theft once the first attack had been carried out).

## 2019

### 2019-Feb: Coinmama - CEX Hack - 450,000 User Emails & Passwords
- This is a slightly less conventional hack, because instead of stealing money the hackers just stole information. Coinmama is one of the largest cryptocurrency brokers with over a million active users. There appears to have been little fallout from this hack, as Coinmama informed users rapidly once they learned that user data was being leaked on the dark web. To date, no cryptocurrency has been stolen.

### 2021-08: Poly Network Exploit - $610M
- An attacker exploited cross-chain relay contracts to extract Poly Network funds from three different chains: Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. 
- The attacker ultimately returned the stolen funds.
- A ‚Äòwhite hat‚Äô hacker pulled off the largest single cryptocurrency hack this year, claiming to have done it to expose the security hole in the ‚Äòcross chain‚Äô smart contracts used by the company.
- The company went on to suspend transactions and fix the bug, even as it negotiated with the hacker and exchanges to freeze the stolen cryptocurrency temporarily. 
- The entire stolen amount was retrieved over the course of a week, with no loss to customers. 
- They offered a job and a reward of $500,000, which the hacker turned down, but later grumbled about getting no reward.
- Poly Network is a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to lend, borrow and trade cryptocurrencies at a profit. 
- Smart contracts are built into a crypto token, with self-executing terms that define what the token should do under different circumstances, for example, sell to entity X at $17.99 if price falls below $18.

### 2021-08-18: Liquid.com - CEX Hack 
- Liquid hackers have continued to move expeditiously to convert assets to ETH and launder those ETH through Tornado.cash
- 107 BTC, 9M TRON, 11M XRP, $60M in ERC-20s $91M
- Ethereum-based assets accounted for over 78% of the loss.
- The hackers routed a part of their loot through decentralised platforms like UniSwap, while assets transferred to other large crypto exchanges were frozen on Liquid‚Äôs request. 
- The Japanese exchange resumed trading after transferring unaffected funds to cold wallets  and upgrading security to implement secure vaults.
- By the end of August, Liquid had said there would be ‚Äúno impact on user balances.‚Äù To compensate users and cover their own losses, the company raised $120M as a loan from the FTX crypto exchange.
- They immediately swapped stolen USDT-on-TRON to TRON within a matter of minutes using a DEX. 
- The quick swaps may be a result of lessons learned from the Poly.Network attack, in which stolen USDT was frozen almost immediately by Tether.
- The hacker also converted ERC-20 tokens into native Ether at a rapid pace. 
- Once converted, the hacker appears content to sit on the haul, pooling almost 15,000 ETH, worth roughly $45 million, in a single address.
- It appears the hacker's ultimate goal is to convert their ETH to BTC using DeFi protocols. 
- Whoever hacked Liquid seems to have had a thorough plan in place prior to acting, and is executing that plan with ruthless efficiency.
