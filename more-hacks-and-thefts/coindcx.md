- Watch the full video here: https://youtube.com/live/NdV95c3hKVw

Q2: Why was there a 17-hour delay in communicating the incident?

- All stakeholders and investigating agencies were immediately informed and onboarded.

- Thorough Investigations had begun immediately with the help of top cybersecurity professionals.

- We wanted to provide factually correct information post the investigation which took us some time.

- It was important to do all checks before a proper public disclosure.

Q3: What has happened to INR withdrawals? Is it resolved?

- All INR withdrawals were processed last night.

- Some delays happened because funds are held in different bank accounts and processing took longer owing to limited functioning of the banks on the weekend.

Q4: Is CoinDCX financially strong enough to absorb the loss? How did we manage the loss?

- Yes, we are stronger than ever, our annual revenue exceeds ₹1,100crores.

- Our balance sheet and treasury are completely healthy and backed by full investor support.

- Our India exchange business is profitable.

- We absorbed the entire loss from our corporate treasury with no impact on user funds.

Q5: Is there any chance of fund recovery?

- We have onboarded top cyber security experts like Zero Shadow, Wormhole, and Solana Foundation to help us with recovery.

- A dedicated internal team of experts has been formed to trace the funds and aim for recovery.

- We assure that our day-to-day operations are not dependent on the recovery.

- We have announced a bounty program with a reward of 25% of the recovered fund.

Q6: Why did the prices of certain tokens like USDT, XRP and Bitcoin drop suddenly? When will this get solved?

- Due to high sell pressure caused by FUD, token prices were impacted for sometime.

- Prices have recovered by 90% and should return to normal within a few days.

Q7: Why were Web3 mode and multiple tokens put under maintenance? What are the current limitations?

- A scheduled downtime took place a day before the incident.

- This was a planned maintenance of 15 spot markets.

- Rest assured the incident has no correlation with the scheduled downtime.

- Current temporary limitations on Web3 mode is in buying/selling with INR and transferring the funds back to your CoinDCX account. Which will be lifted by this week.

Q8: Why are crypto withdrawals not enabled for me?

- Crypto withdrawals are a risk‑first feature.

- Crypto withdrawals are live for 10,000+ users today, with a phased rollout in the future to the wider community to ensure maximum security.

Q9: What should you do? Are your funds safe?

- Please rely only on official, trusted communication channels.

- Don’t fall for FUD. Reach out to us in case of any questions.

- We assure you that all customer funds are 100% secure in cold wallets.
