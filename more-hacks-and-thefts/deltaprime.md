In the final two weeks of reporting alone, two of those projects were hacked: Truflation and a crypto borrowing app called Delta Prime

It's too early to determine if either hack was directly connected to any inadvertent hiring of DPRK IT workers.

Delta Prime [was breached first](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/16/crypto-broker-deltaprime-drained-of-over-6m-amid-apparent-private-key-leak/), on Sept. 16. 

CoinDesk had previously [uncovered payments](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tracer/2a36a990-d9b4-4e63-9ce7-18baf92bf0db) and [code contributions](https://github.com/DeltaPrimeLabs/deltaprime-primeloans/commits/dev/main/) connecting Delta Prime to [Naoki Murano](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x6188a9e76794e7cb337b8E5a2B91808Ce34Fc6D1), one of the DPRK-linked developers [publicized](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824118137668997511) by ZachXBT, the pseudonymous blockchain sleuth.

The project lost more than $7 million, [officially because](https://x.com/DeltaPrimeDefi/status/1835603279369125893) of "a compromised private key." Delta Prime did not respond to numerous requests for comment.
