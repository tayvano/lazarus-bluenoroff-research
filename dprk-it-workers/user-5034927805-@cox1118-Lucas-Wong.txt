[Polkadot Developer Support] [https://t.me/substratedevs/13483] | 5/20/2025 4:50:03 AM: can you help me understand what you mean by weight here?
[Polkadot Developer Support] [https://t.me/substratedevs/13481] | 5/20/2025 4:46:15 AM: I am working on a standalone substrate chain without tip system, in that case, complex extrinsic that requires higher compute should have higher priority?
[Polkadot Developer Support] [https://t.me/substratedevs/13479] | 5/20/2025 4:42:01 AM: here fee based ordering considers tip or only transaction fee?

[Sonic Builders] [https://t.me/SonicBuilders/18414] | 3/11/2025 7:13:57 PM: Hi. who is responsible for technical issue?
I have some errors while bridging token with sonic native gateway.

I've got proof with this code:
async function generateProof(depositId) {
    // Generate storage slot for deposit
    const storageSlot = ethers.utils.keccak256(
        ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(['uint256', 'uint8'], [depositId, 7])
    );
    
    // Get proof from Ethereum node
    const proof = await ethProvider.send("eth_getProof", [
        ETH_CONTRACTS.TOKEN_DEPOSIT,
        [storageSlot],
        "latest"
    ]);
    
    // Encode proof in required format
    return ethers.utils.RLP.encode([
        ethers.utils.RLP.encode(proof.accountProof),
        ethers.utils.RLP.encode(proof.storageProof[0].proof)
    ]);
}

and used depositId, token, amount, and proof as parameter of claim function
but it returns error - execution reverted: Invalid root hash
