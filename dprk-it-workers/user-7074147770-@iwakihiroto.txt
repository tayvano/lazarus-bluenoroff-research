[ReactJs Developers 🇮🇳 [Backup]] [https://t.me/React_JS_India2/13100] | 9/6/2024 11:13:05 AM: we had a video call before start to work on his project.
so I trusted him and he wanted biweekly payment and no upfront.
I agreed with that and I worked on his job honestly for 2 weeks and finished his project perfectly.
after I deliver the project, he removed me in his git repo and deleted all chat history.
I didnt get paid and he is very shameless.
Please be aware of this fucking scammer
