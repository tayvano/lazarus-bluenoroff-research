[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/22349] | 5/23/2025 12:18:09 PM: If you're interacting with our dapp, it should be fine. Sometimes simulations in wallet apps are inaccurate.
However, for better safety, you can try it again.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/22347] | 5/23/2025 12:16:18 PM: It has base transaction fee + priority fee + rent exemption fee.

Any fees you've spent for rent exemption fee can be technically reclaimable. (this is one off thing)
i.e. when you claim vested tokens, it may create sort of a new account on onchain for tracking purpose which it will need SOL to store data.
Also you should also pay for rent fee to create STB token account.

This is how Solana transactions work.
Transaction fee + priority fee is considered gas and it is not reclaimable.
Priority fee might be high when the network is congested so you should be careful when you're approving transactions.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/22023] | 5/22/2025 10:00:17 PM: Have you checked this?
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/22019] | 5/22/2025 9:56:08 PM: You can redeem both of them. You just purchased in 2 different sales and they have different vesting schedule.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/21274] | 5/22/2025 11:42:10 AM: Please check the first release date man. Private sale has 2 mo of lock period.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/21271] | 5/22/2025 11:41:32 AM: It's in STB. This is STB mining. You can claim STB rewards earned anytime.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/21268] | 5/22/2025 11:40:51 AM: Everything will be clear once the UI is open after TGE. Every details are in the UI after you first redeemed your initial unlocked tokens.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/21262] | 5/22/2025 11:39:24 AM: You can redeem released IOU anytime. It's just you generate additional staking rewards while your tokens are in vesting period (locked) following tokenomics.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/21254] | 5/22/2025 11:37:20 AM: Your tokens in vesting will be automatically staked and you will get staking rewards.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/20624] | 5/21/2025 11:14:21 AM: The benefit of locking is you earn multiplied rewards than staking. The longer you lock your STB, the more rewards you will receive.
Your locked STB will also unlock your voting power at stabble.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/20623] | 5/21/2025 11:13:35 AM: Staking allows you quit anytime.
Locking does now allow you quit in the lock period.
[Hylo Alpha Chat] [https://t.me/hylo_so/4729] | 5/14/2025 11:17:58 AM: GMylo!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15992] | 4/10/2025 6:44:40 PM: If you'd already staked LP tokens for STB and later ZEUS rewards added to the pool, then you should restake your staked LP tokens for ZEUS rewards.
This is one-off migration.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15491] | 4/3/2025 10:06:28 PM: It's APY, so you will get 25% in fees in an year. However, this APY changes over time. It's projection of annual percentage of yield based on the performance of the last 24h/7d/30d.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15382] | 4/2/2025 11:30:06 PM: Yes we did! I think we've already mentioned about it in your ticket.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15375] | 4/2/2025 11:24:33 PM: Hey, why don't you create a ticket? I have too many DMs and I normally skip it unless it's mentioned publicly.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15238] | 4/1/2025 8:03:30 PM: Staking rewards are not auto-compounded. They are not part of liquidity pool but additional reward pools where you can farm and claim your earned rewards.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15107] | 3/31/2025 7:13:16 PM: We will release a patch so that it will work without clearing your cache.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/15106] | 3/31/2025 7:12:55 PM: Stake your LP to get additional rewards. Announcement coming soon. Stay tuned. 😊

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/14584] | 3/26/2025 6:35:54 PM: Scam!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/14526] | 3/26/2025 10:59:55 AM: "Contract address" is not available yet.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/14523] | 3/26/2025 10:43:52 AM: Hi Alexandru, CA is not yet available.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/13454] | 3/16/2025 12:32:35 PM: Feel free to dm.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/12376] | 3/5/2025 11:26:01 PM: It should be done via governance later because AMP can manipulate the price of the pool, which it may harm for other LP holders joined the pool.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/12124] | 3/4/2025 4:37:52 PM: Stable pools are for - USDC-USDT, SOL-mSOL, mSOL-bSOL, cbBTC-WBTC, etc.
Weighted pools are for - SOL-USDC, JUP-SOL, RETARDIO-SOL, etc.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/12123] | 3/4/2025 4:36:55 PM: Hi everyone, please note that stable pools are for assets that has price correlations, NOT for volatile assets.
For example, SOL-USDC is never a case for stable pool. In a simple words, 1 SOL is considered to 1 USDC in stable pool.
So if you create SOL-USDC pool as a stable one, you will be in a huge LOSS!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/8378] | 2/7/2025 12:10:26 AM: It distributes at 00:00 UTC every day.
Sometimes, there might be issues in transaction landing, but your counted rewards for the failed transactions are accrued and will be airdropped to your wallet in the next airdrop.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/6788] | 1/28/2025 11:53:25 AM: We are currently upgrading database instance. It takes more than expected. It will be back soon.
Sorry for delayed announcement.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/6594] | 1/24/2025 11:38:25 AM: Yes, it does. LST APY more likely moves by Solana epoch in general, not by 24h fyi.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/6465] | 1/22/2025 8:01:32 PM: Probably scam. We do not dm you in general.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/5886] | 1/16/2025 11:07:39 PM: We are on it.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/5865] | 1/16/2025 3:12:18 PM: Move your funds to a new wallet immediately if you still have your assets in  your wallet.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/5716] | 1/14/2025 6:10:39 PM: @abdizzedo I banned this user! scam
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/5351] | 1/7/2025 2:54:07 PM: Alright, he is not from @stabble.org.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/5348] | 1/7/2025 2:52:14 PM: May I get the sender's email address?
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/4814] | 12/31/2024 2:37:42 AM: We will release new robust transaction indexer in few weeks.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/4813] | 12/31/2024 2:37:16 AM: Pools are performing as normal. We are still working with new transaction indexer.
Backfill just started refilling missing data.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/4391] | 12/26/2024 9:10:20 PM: We are looking at it rn.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/3119] | 12/17/2024 5:43:54 PM: Could you please let me know your wallet address in DM?
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/3098] | 12/17/2024 3:03:16 PM: Yes it does!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/2956] | 12/16/2024 8:46:33 PM: Feel free to DM. I do believe we've already mailed you with some guides.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/2554] | 12/10/2024 6:33:13 PM: When did you create the pool? It will take few mins for the new pools/tokens to be registered automatically.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/2550] | 12/10/2024 6:19:38 PM: Our team will review newly created pools every 24h (Mon - Fri) to see if they are eligible for verification.

We will basically review if:
- TVL: over $5k
- the pool was created with proper params technically
- followed LP token metadata standard when you create pools

Feel free to create a ticket for technical support on Discord.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/2544] | 12/10/2024 6:04:15 PM: Hi @Ramon_Serrano_971, feel free to create a technical ticket on discord.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/2265] | 12/4/2024 2:57:00 PM: Hi @Multi_Task, this should have been resolved now!

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1948] | 11/25/2024 7:35:12 PM: Let me reach out to Sonar.watch team. It's a bug from their end.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1913] | 11/24/2024 5:44:02 PM: I think there was a volume bot running against it. 24h volume was 10.2b yesterday.
7d volume is still 10.2b and the 3.8b is still part of 10.2b peak yesterday I assume.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1834] | 11/22/2024 1:29:06 PM: Please make sure if you deposited same $ worth. There should not be any issues in this process.
If you could share your transaction history and/or wallet address we can take a look.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1832] | 11/22/2024 1:25:46 PM: FYI - USDS-USDT-USDC pool is 16h old only.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1831] | 11/22/2024 1:25:14 PM: Can you please create a ticket on Discord with more details like your wallet address, LP amount, etc.
I don't understand your current situation because the points system is working as expected.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1828] | 11/22/2024 12:44:44 PM: If you're owner of USDC-USDT pool, then you earn 70pts/day per USD value of your LP token.
For USDS-USDC-USDT, you earn 50pts/day per USD value of your LP because you're not owner of the pool.

Thanks! CC: @IQzzer
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1782] | 11/21/2024 6:18:56 PM: Hi @Grsk0x, we acknowledged this issue and are currently working on it. We will release the patch asap!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1671] | 11/19/2024 12:40:35 PM: Yes, you can!
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1666] | 11/19/2024 12:26:05 PM: You can first withdraw in all tokens and then swap SOL for vSOL on jup.ag.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1665] | 11/19/2024 12:25:32 PM: Hey @jupicycat, imbalanced deposit/withdraw may lead you in an unwanted loss from price changes. It's recommended to make a balanced deposit/withdraw to withdraw your funds at minimum slippage possible.
Single token deposit/withdraw has less effect when you are depositing/withdrawing a very small portion of liquidity which it does not affect pools price much post deposit/withdraw.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1637] | 11/18/2024 7:44:19 PM: It is your spot PnL since you've checked your LP position last time.
APY is [fees / TVL] based + [daily reward emissions rate / TVL] (optionally if the pool supports it).
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1633] | 11/18/2024 6:37:22 PM: It's on the way. Infrastructure has already started taking snapshot of historical TVL, LP supply.
We will have UI ready this week so that you can check historical performance of the pools in details page.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1622] | 11/18/2024 3:52:44 PM: We are making some update to the PnL tracker. It will be more straight forward once the changes are released soon.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1504] | 11/15/2024 9:27:06 PM: @conorbrittain
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1502] | 11/15/2024 9:26:30 PM: 1/ Not stable TVL, pool owners can withdraw huge liquidity without any notice.
2/ No active risk mitigation supported in case of depeg.
3/ No official support for LP tokens. LP tokens will have more support like liquidity mining, potentially support with lending markets in the future.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1492] | 11/15/2024 7:30:05 PM: If the pool is empty, we automatically close and send rent exemption fee back to the creator.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1491] | 11/15/2024 7:29:46 PM: It's just technically possible. You cannot close the pool if there is still other LP holders there.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1488] | 11/15/2024 7:21:35 PM: It will cost less than 0.016 SOL except transaction fee & priority fee.
Here, 0.00493428 SOL is technically reclaimable when you fully closed your LP token account and the pool.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1463] | 11/15/2024 12:11:25 PM: I don't think it's possible as they are DEXes; they more likely focused on utilizing their own pools and there is no official support for such integration.
Jupiter is DEX aggregator that put them all in their swap router.
Nonetheless, Meteora does not even have their own swap UI, although direct swap is available for some pools.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1448] | 11/15/2024 12:41:46 AM: It's unverified because the owner has not yet reached out to us.
LP token's metadata should follow stabble's LP token standard, which we support it once he reaches out to us.
This TVL is temporary as he might drain his funds from the pool one day without any notice.
So, for better risk management for LP holders, we do not verify anonymous pools to avoid any potential troubles.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/1316] | 11/13/2024 5:57:53 PM: GOAT-SOL should've been verified first to be eligible for points rewards.

[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/590] | 11/4/2024 1:46:51 AM: Yes right. We planned to allow whitelisted users (early investors) still farm STB rewards while their tokens allocated are vested.
[stabble community chat] [https://t.me/stabble_org/588] | 11/4/2024 1:41:16 AM: Yes, it will work this way for sure!

It's been a while that I have seen something valuable in this channel. :)
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1677] | 8/2/2022 2:11:55 AM: Hum... not sure. Never tried it before yet.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1674] | 8/2/2022 2:08:47 AM: It will be a mess if tons of arbitrary serialized transactions are submitted to backend.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1673] | 8/2/2022 2:07:54 AM: Ah you can skip step 1 if you don't need any server side private key sign to transaction for security.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1671] | 8/2/2022 2:01:50 AM: Perfect!
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1669] | 8/2/2022 2:00:25 AM: 1. serialize tx in backend
2. sign tx in dapp, submit signed tx message to backend again
3. execute tx in backend, get tx id and store it to database
4. cronjob looks for tx_id in every 5 mins to mark it as success or fail
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1668] | 8/2/2022 1:59:10 AM: I would rather recommend to use Transaction serialization in backend.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1667] | 8/2/2022 1:58:32 AM: Not accurate! The same problem in EVM as well. We can't trust on WS events for TX subscription.
It's more useful for realtime stats update.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1665] | 8/2/2022 1:57:39 AM: Sequential transactions should not be made from backend separately from the transaction on dapp.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1664] | 8/2/2022 1:56:39 AM: I think you're doing in a wrong way then. :D
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1661] | 8/2/2022 1:53:11 AM: Sometimes Solana performance is not good.
[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1660] | 8/2/2022 1:52:55 AM: It depends on the RPC server's performance or so.

[Parasol Finance | Solana Projects Incubator] [https://t.me/solanadev_co/1656] | 8/2/2022 1:33:43 AM: It depends on the confirmation level you've used.
Normally it takes like 30 seconds for a transaction to be fully confirmed at level "MAX".
Better to set confirmation level to "confirmed" which takes almost immediately unless Solana is experiencing degraded performance.

[Solana Development Hub] [https://t.me/solanadev/3850] | 5/25/2022 8:22:18 PM: Also make sure you have passed all the required accounts in instruction.
[Solana Development Hub] [https://t.me/solanadev/3849] | 5/25/2022 8:21:47 PM: Are you sure you have deployed the latest program?
[Solana Development Hub] [https://t.me/solanadev/3847] | 5/25/2022 8:01:00 PM: You might have old version of IDL in your dapp.
[Solana Development Hub] [https://t.me/solanadev/3796] | 5/19/2022 3:37:58 PM: Nope. ;)
Solana does not have any gas fee though. it just have transaction fee + rent exemption fees if there is any new accounts are being created in the transaction.
