[48Club Infrastructure] [https://t.me/infra_48club/27506] | 4/18/2025 2:13:25 PM: Hi, I am newbie with Puissant. and as I checked, I can send tx with discounted gas price if I entered to Entry Membership.
so I entered membership but I am not sure how I can send tx with discounted gas price.
and also the how much I can discount gas price. ofc, there is formula for this - Your Soul Point * 10000.
so for example, if I have 60 soul point, how much can I discount gas price?

[Smart Contracts Developers ED] [https://t.me/smart_contracts_dev/25780] | 10/31/2023 9:35:13 AM: yeah, he scammed me too.
[Smart Contracts Developers ED] [https://t.me/smart_contracts_dev/25770] | 10/31/2023 5:40:39 AM: based on how smart contract developed. If smart contract has withdraw function that don't limit permission. it's possible.
Except that, based on how smart contract developed, there can be several vulnerabilities to withdraw funds.
