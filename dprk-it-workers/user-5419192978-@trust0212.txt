I have over 5 years of experience in developing web3 frontends using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Next.js, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Viem, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi and GraphQL. 

I am passionate about building user-friendly, scalable, and secure web3 frontends that leverage the power of blockchain and decentralized protocols.

Some of the web3 projects that I have worked on include:

•  NFT lending platform that enables NFT holders to unlock liquidity by borrowing against the value of their assets and brings about a peer-to-peer lending opportunity for individuals to lend capital for a set interest rate, backed by the underlying NFT assets.(liqdnft.com)
•  Multichain NFT marketplace(dapp.sundrip.io)
•  on-chain assets management system that allows users to create and manage investment vaults.(testnet.dexify.io)
•  binary options platform that enables the users to predicts whether the price of a specific digital asset will rise or fall within a predetermined time frame(ryze.fi)
•  2 NFT Minting Site
•  A web3 dashboard that displays real-time data and analytics of various DeFi protocols and tokens.
•  A web3 portfolio manager that helps users track and manage their crypto assets and NFTs across different chains and platforms.

Based on my experiences and expertise, I am looking for a new opportunity to contribute to your team.

[KeyFi (Official)] [https://t.me/keyfi_ai/51556] | 12/7/2023 12:40:50 AM: It’s way too hard for new users to start using web3 apps.
Have your team ever thought about introducing smart accounts?
That makes it possible to build a web3 app that feels like web2: simple and familiar for mainstream users.
I think if your team introduces a smart account, your team can onboard many users.
If your team introduce smart accounts that leverage account abstraction,
a new user can:
- create a smart account directly in your app without third-party downloads
- sign up with an email, social login, passkey, or self-custodial wallet like metamask
- submit transactions without needing ETH in their account for gas
- submit transactions in the background without leaving your app
- batch transaction

[NEAR Blockchain Jobs Group | Post CV/Job Offers] [https://t.me/near_jobs/1926] | 11/14/2023 5:14:04 PM: In terms of describing my role at Dexify, in a nutshell I designed and led the building of an on-chain assets management system as a CTO.
On-chain asset management system is a typical DeFi system.
For that I studied carefully about several DeFi ecosystems and at last we came up with the most effective and scalable solutions.
In the Dexify platform, the users could create a vault, and could indicate the other users as a vault manager.
The users who were indicated as a manager are responsible for managing the funds in the vault and could create yields with the funds in the vault by trading in the external DEXes, like pancake wap.
For this complete system, we created several upgradeable smart contracts that are divided into 3 levels.
Also, we used a NestJS framework for the backend.
[NEAR Blockchain Jobs Group | Post CV/Job Offers] [https://t.me/near_jobs/1925] | 11/14/2023 5:13:55 PM: At Balance Capital, we built a Crypto Binary Options Trading Platform, which allows the users to predict the movement of certain crypto-currency within a predetermined time frame.
In our platform, the users can predict the movement of BTC, ETH within 1, 3, 5 mins.
At the expiration of the selected time frame, the platform compares the current price of the cryptocurrency with the user's prediction.
If the user's prediction is correct, he receives a predetermined payout, while the user's prediction is incorrect, he loses the invested amount.
For this, we used various technologies like diamond pattern, building our own oracle system, and referral systems. Backend is necessary in smart contract development to enhance the functionality, security, and usability of decentralized applications.
We used a NestJS framework for building our own oracle systems and referral systems, as a backend framework.
By building our oracle network, we could get the exact coin price by aggregating the prices from several exchanges and by building the referral systems, we could allow the users to get passive income. 
And also by introducing smart accounts that leverage account abstraction, we could be able to allow new users can sign up with an email, social login, or self-custodial wallet and submit transactions without needing ETH in their account for gas and enable batch transaction
We used ERC-4337 standard for this.
