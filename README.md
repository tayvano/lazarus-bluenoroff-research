# Lazarus / DPRK / Cryptocurrency / Web3 / Etc.

Used to just be all the Bluenoroff hacks. Back when I was not insane. Now it's a dumping ground for everything. üòÖ

# Hacks: By Cluster

- [See all the details & articles at /lazarus-evolution](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/lazarus-evolution.md)

- DPRK has many teams. They operate independently. The laundry stays separate. The indicators are different. The malware is different.

- The clusters and teams change over time and have many names.

- This is how I cluster them.

- My research is primarily onchain and directly from victim reports. It is aided by reports and OSINT done by those tracking the malware, c2s, etc. 

- **I often get it wrong** bc the clustering and dynamic nature of DPRK is insane to keep track of. Don't take any of this as gospel. I am always learning.

## üîë SquidSquad - Fake VC Shit - DangerousPassword / Sapphire Sleet / Alluring Pisces
- aka: CryptoCore, APT38, Bluenoroff, Leery Turtle, SnatchCrypto, CryptoMimic, UNC1069, Black Alicanto, CageyChameleon
- VC impersonating, Telegram messagers, fake video meet calls, Fake Google Drive links, RustBucket, Mac malware, Applescript, malicious PDFs, "Fast changes to stablecoin risk.pdf"



## üîê DangerousPassword - Job Shit
- Apparently also DangerousPassword shit but is completely separate onchain so we keep it off to the side a bit.
- Astrill, Mullvad. Tornado Cash to Wormhole or eXch. Gets lost in Tornado with all the other DPRK shit.



## üëõ TraderTraitor - Jade Sleet / Slow Pisces / UNC4899
- The big boys, the insane on-chain laundry sessions. 
- Targets technical / backend guys with fake job offers or requests for help.



## üçé Applejeus - Citrine Sleet / Gleaming Pisces / UNC4736
- aka: Gleaming Pisces, Labyrinth Chollima, Hidden Cobra, DEV-0139
- Has been active since at least 2018. Today they aren't seen hacking as much. They seem to sometimes have a relationship with ITW or Contagious Interview guys? They also have shitcoin farms but we don't talk about that.



## üíº DPRK IT Workers
- Overlaps with Contagious Interview a lot. IT Workers Have resumes. Get hired. Get paid payroll that goes to DPRK.
- Will hack via backdoors, stealing private keys. Will also get hacked. Will also extort. They are creative little fucks.



## üéôÔ∏è Contagious Interview
- "Willo" Job Campaigns, Bybit assessment, trevorgreer, Beavertail, Invisible Ferret
- Connects cases onchain. Is a real fucking mess. Stargate / Defiway / RhinoFi / Railgun / Dust Collectors.

# Purpose

- no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. i've follow lazarus for a long, long time

- i had multiple irl friends back in the day who worked at sony. now i have had multiple friends, founders, builders, users who have been rekt by these same fools, grown up

- if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it

- realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...and want to steal all your crypto...it's a lot

- thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. üï≥Ô∏èüêá
