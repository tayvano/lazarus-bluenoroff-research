# Hacks: By Cluster

- [See all the details & articles at /lazarus-evolution](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/lazarus-evolution.md)

- DPRK has many teams. They operate independently. The laundry stays separate. The indicators are different. The malware is different.

- The clusters and teams change over time and have many names.

- This is how I cluster them.

- My research is primarily onchain and directly from victim reports. It is aided by reports and OSINT done by those tracking the malware, c2s, etc. 

- **I often get it wrong** bc the clustering and dynamic nature of DPRK is insane to keep track of. Don't take any of this as gospel. I am always learning.

# Purpose

- no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. i've follow lazarus for a long, long time

- i had multiple irl friends back in the day who worked at sony. now i have had multiple friends, founders, builders, users who have been rekt by these same fools, grown up

- if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it

- realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...and want to steal all your crypto...it's a lot

- thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. 🕳️🐇
