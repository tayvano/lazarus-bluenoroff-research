# Breaking Down / Mapping the Clusters

[See more at /lazarus-evolution](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/lazarus-evolution.md)

Note: all my research starts onchain and works backwards from there using victim reports and osint done by those tracking the malware, c2s, etc. I often get it wrong bc the clustering and dynamic nature of DPRK is insane to keep track of.


## 🔑 SquidSquad / Sapphire Sleet / DangerousPassword

- aka: CryptoCore, APT38, Bluenoroff, Alluring Pisces, Leery Turtle, SnatchCrypto, CryptoMimic, UNC1069, Black Alicanto
- This group has targeted financial institutions, cryptocurrency businesses and ATMs. It has also conducted significant cyber heists.
- Appears to maintain a revenue generation priority, like its overarching APT38 subunits, however on a much smaller financial scale.
- 2023/2024 activity usually referred to as **SquidSquad** by on-chain folks
- Today: VC impersonating, Telegram messagers, fake video meet calls, Fake Google Drive links, RustBucket, Mac malware, Applescript. Tornado Cash, eXch, Noones, Paxful, Instaswappers.
- Before: Google Drive phishing, malicious PDFs, "Fast changes to stablecoin risk.pdf", `Password.txt.lnk`, Tornado Cash, Renbridge, Chipmixer, Noones, Paxful. Dust Collectors!
- Past Attacks: A4 (Founder/CEO), I4 (Founder/CEO of DeFi Thing), C4 (defi media person), C7 (CEO of blockchain infra company), ALEX Labs, Samudai Founder, Maverick Founder, Fantom Foundation CEO, Coinshift C-Level, Steadefi, GERA Coin, deBridge (Attempt), Wonderhero, Arthur_0x, bZx, YFETH Admin Key, Metaplay / Polyplay, MNGR, Bondly Finance, Tower Capital, NAOs Finance, FinNexus Admin Key, 990.1 BTC, EasyFi Founder, Mudge / Etna / Mokens Deployer, Indodax ATO, Hugh Karp / Nexus Mutual, L2 Theft (crypto investor), LEAD Wallet Token, CoinMetro, Unibright, Tap Global, Coinberry, Fetch.ai

## 👛 TraderTraitor / Jade Sleet

- The big boys, the insane on-chain laundry sessions
- Targets blockchain companies through spear-phishing messages, fake job offers
- Messages employees, particularly those in system administration or software development roles, on various communication platforms, intended to gain access to these start-up and high-tech companies
- Today: Job offers and/or skills tests in python, sql, etc. Github, malicious npm packages are utilized. Personas on Linkedin usually white and impersonating/cloned legit profile. Github repos may be private. Conversation style usually more casual, conversational, adaptable? 
- Before: Same except ultimately deliverered malicious electron trading apps
- More time passes between compromise and theft (at times 6+ months) making it especially hard to identify intiial social engineering that led to compromise.
- May be the work of operators previously responsible for broader APT38 activity
- On-chain Observations: Express VPN, occasional leak of Ryugyong-dong IPs
- Example applications (all designed to appear as legitimate cryptocurrency trading or portfolio management tools): TokenAIS, CryptAIS, CreAI Deck, AlticGO, and Esilet
- Past Attacks: WazriX, DMM Bitcoin, Poloniex, HTX/Heco, Stake, Coinex, Alphapo, Coinspaid, Atomic Wallet, JumpCloud, 3CX, Harmony, Ronin

## 💼 DPRK IT Workers

- Merlin DEX, Munchables, Solareum, a bunch of unknown others or misidentified shit from Contagious Interview.
- Have resumes. Get hired. Get paid payroll that goes to DPRK.
- Primarily fall under the KWP’s Munitions Industry Department
- Made up of thousands of highly skilled IT workers from North Korea
- Deployed both domestically and abroad to generate revenue and finance the country's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs
- Acquire freelance contracts from clients around the world and sometimes pretend to be based in the US or other countries to secure employment.
- Mainly engage in legitimate IT work, they have misused their access to enable malicious cyber intrusions.

## 🎙️ Contagious Interview

- New onchain cluster / laundry patterns first observed early 2023, fully baked out by late 2023
- UnoReDAO, OKX Dex, ConcentricFi, Serenity Shield, Wilder World, Hyve, on and on and on and on and on. Also the Upwork/Braintrust/Linkedin Job Scams. Flickthebean, etc.
- Connects af onchain. Is a real fucking mess. Stargate / Defiway / RhinoFi / Railgun / Dust Collectors. 
- In the cases of protocol exploits, the private keys that have critical access are compromised and used to upgrade the protocol in order to mint an infinite amount of new tokens or drain the protocol of any locked assets. Lots of `transferOwnerships`.
- On the social engineering side: Developers often reach out to the attacker in response to a job or freelance post. The attacker asks them to complete a job interview, skills test, or fix some issues in an existing codebase. Details about the test or code issues are often provided via Google Docs or similar text document. They have much more information and provide actual requirements, as opposed to some of the conversations seen used in TraderTraitor. The code is typically provided via Github, Bitbucket, or a zip file hosted on Google Drive. They are Javascript / Node JS projects and use npm install / run / build. Often the personal addresses that are active and in unlocked browser extensions or desktop wallets are drained of all assets nearly immediately. Shortly thereafter, these private keys, or additional private keys stored on the developers machine, are further drained of assets and/or used to exploit smart contracts or protocols.
- There are also cases where the attacker reaches out to a developer or dev shop or asking to hire / contract them to help finish a project. They then grant the dev shop access to a private (malicious) repo. The lead of the dev shop will then run the repo to see what the issue is, what work is required, and provide a quote. That tech lead's device is thus compromised, alongside their own wallets/projects or previous clients.
- Public reporting and first-hand victim reports often make these incidents sound like a malicious employee or insider or new hire is responsible and thus leads to them being tagged as DPRK IT Workers. However, more often it is simply that an employee’s device was compromised and their access was used. The key difference in victim reports is whether they actually hired and paid. For IT Workers, often the team will have and mention resumes, payroll, etc.

# Purpose

- no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. i've follow lazarus for a long, long time

- i had multiple irl friends back in the day who worked at sony. now i have had multiple friends, founders, builders, users who have been rekt by these same fools, grown up

- if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it

- realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...and want to steal all your crypto...it's a lot

- thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. 🕳️🐇
