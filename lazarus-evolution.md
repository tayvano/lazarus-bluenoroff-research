## 🍎 Applejeus / Citrine Sleet / UNC4736

- aka: Gleaming Pisces, Labyrinth Chollima, Hidden Cobra, DEV-0139
- A threat group that has been active since at least 2018
- This group performed attacks targeting the cryptocurrency industry and is known for its association with the AppleJeus campaign.
- Primarily targets: financial institutions, particularly organizations and individuals managing cryptocurrency, for financial gain.
- Has conducted extensive reconnaissance of the cryptocurrency industry and individuals associated with it
- Creates fake websites masquerading as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and uses them to distribute fake job applications or lure targets into downloading a weaponized cryptocurrency wallet or trading application based on legitimate applications
- Most commonly infects targets with the unique trojan malware it developed, AppleJeus, which collects information necessary to seize control of the targets’ cryptocurrency assets
- The FudModule rootkit described in [this blog](https://microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/08/30/north-korean-threat-actor-citrine-sleet-exploiting-chromium-zero-day/) has now been tied to Citrine Sleet as shared tooling with Diamond Sleet.
- Like TraderTraitor, this crypto-focused group appeared to emerge after the notoriety that came with the Bangladesh heist and issues with stealing and laundering traditional currency. 
- This group’s tools overlap with TEMP.Hermit, but is not focused on the same targeting profiles, potentially indicating shared resources.

## 🎙️ Contagious Interview

- 2024: Beavertail / Invisible Ferret
- 2025: "Willo" Job Campaigns, Bybit assessment, trevorgreer
- New onchain cluster / laundry patterns first observed early 2023, fully baked out by late 2023
- This may actually map back to some dudes that originally did TraderTraitor or APT38 type stuff like Nexus Mutual but I dunno yet. On-chain they certainly Dust Collect like Hugh Karp / EasyFi / etc. and they certainly love to compromise private keys and pivot to taking over protocols but most everything else is different.
- UnoReDAO, OKX Dex, ConcentricFi, Serenity Shield, Wilder World, Hyve, on and on and on and on and on. Also the Upwork/Braintrust/Linkedin Job Scams. Flickthebean, etc.
- Connects af onchain. Is a real fucking mess. Stargate / Defiway / RhinoFi / Railgun / Dust Collectors. 
- In the cases of protocol exploits, the private keys that have critical access are compromised and used to upgrade the protocol in order to mint an infinite amount of new tokens or drain the protocol of any locked assets. Lots of `transferOwnerships`.
- On the social engineering side: Developers often reach out to the attacker in response to a job or freelance post. The attacker asks them to complete a job interview, skills test, or fix some issues in an existing codebase. Details about the test or code issues are often provided via Google Docs or similar text document. They have much more information and provide actual requirements, as opposed to some of the conversations seen used in TraderTraitor. The code is typically provided via Github, Bitbucket, or a zip file hosted on Google Drive. They are Javascript / Node JS projects and use npm install / run / build. Often the personal addresses that are active and in unlocked browser extensions or desktop wallets are drained of all assets nearly immediately. Shortly thereafter, these private keys, or additional private keys stored on the developers machine, are further drained of assets and/or used to exploit smart contracts or protocols.
- There are also cases where the attacker reaches out to a developer or dev shop or asking to hire / contract them to help finish a project. They then grant the dev shop access to a private (malicious) repo. The lead of the dev shop will then run the repo to see what the issue is, what work is required, and provide a quote. That tech lead's device is thus compromised, alongside their own wallets/projects or previous clients.
- Public reporting and first-hand victim reports often make these incidents sound like a malicious employee or insider or new hire is responsible and thus leads to them being tagged as DPRK IT Workers. However, more often it is simply that an employee’s device was compromised and their access was used. The key difference in victim reports is whether they actually hired and paid. For IT Workers, often the team will have and mention resumes, payroll, etc.

## Andariel / APT45 / Onyx Sleet / UNC614 / Jumpy Pisces
- This group has primarily conducted cyberespionage, but it has also conducted ransomware activity.
- Known for its broader scope of operations, Andariel targets both government and private sector entities, including financial services and cryptocurrency companies.
- Their methods include exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used software, such as the Log4j vulnerability, to deploy bespoke malware and gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems
- This actor targets foreign businesses, government agencies, financial services infrastructure, private corporations, and the defense industry. UNC614 also engages in cyber crime as an extra source of income to fund their operations, including the [ransoming of hospitals](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/22-00021780), using their own ransomware malware dubbed [MAUI](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/22-00019069). However, their primary focus is on targeting military and government personnel. 
- This cyber group stands apart from the other DPRK aligned groups and typically does not fall into the blending and targeting that the others may do. Some groups have espionage and financial focuses, but Andariel is tasked to acquire information to “build” the weapons of mass destruction or research and development programs in other targeted fields, like pharmaceuticals. 
- The targeting trends, such as nuclear, aerospace, high heat molds, etc. and overall successful compromises of this actor make it quite possibly the scariest of all the DPRK affiliated groups.
- Primary targeting: Defense, Aerospace, Healthcare (when self-funding operations), Nuclear

## TEMP.Hermit / Diamond Sleet / UNC2970
- aka: UNC2970, Selective Pisces, ZINC, Labyrinth Chollima
- This group has targeted media, defense and IT organizations
- Prioritizes espionage, data theft, financial gain, and network destruction
- Mandiant said the threat cluster shares "multiple overlaps" with a long-running operation dubbed "Dream Job" that employs job recruitment lures in email messages to trigger the infection sequence.
- TEMP.Hermit, is an actor that has been active since at least 2013. Their operations since that time are representative of Pyongyang's efforts to collect strategic intelligence to benefit North Korean interests. This actor targets government, defense, telecommunications, and financial institutions worldwide and the term “Lazarus Group” refers most often to this cluster of activities. AppleJeus maintains overlap with this organization, but TEMP.Hermit’s targeting continues to focus on espionage related activities and not cryptocurrency as its primary focus.
- ZINC is a highly operational, destructive, and sophisticated nation-state activity group. Active since 2009, the activity group gained further public notoriety in 2014 following their successful attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. ZINC is known to use a variety of custom remote access tools (RATs) as part of their arsenal, including those detected by Microsoft as FoggyBrass and PhantomStar.  
- Applejeus/Citrine Sleet's tools overlap with TEMP.Hermit, but is not focused on the same targeting profiles, potentially indicating shared resources.
- The actor that Microsoft tracks as Diamond Sleet (formerly ZINC) is a North Korea-based activity group known to target media, defense, and IT industries globally. Diamond Sleet focuses on espionage, theft of personal and corporate data, financial gain, and corporate network destruction.
- Diamond Sleet is known to use a variety of custom malware that is exclusive to the group. Recent Diamond Sleet malware is described in Microsoft’s reporting of the group’s weaponization of open source software and exploitation of N-day vulnerabilities. Diamond Sleet overlaps with activity tracked by other security companies as Temp.Hermit and Labyrinth Chollima.
- Primary targeting: Government, Defense, Telecommunications
- Mandiant Managed Defense has reported similar activity in 2022 attributed to UNC4034, which later got merged into UNC2970.

## APT37
- Group123, InkySquid, Moldy Pisces, Operation Daybreak, Operation Erebus, Reaper, Reaper Group, Red Eyes, Ricochet Chollima, ScarCruft, Venus 121
- APT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities
- APT37's assessed primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of DPRK's strategic military, political, and economic interests. The group has been observed targeting a wide range of industries, primarily in South Korea. This organization is most closely aligned with the efforts of the MSS and its overarching cyber activities highlight the monitoring of defectors abroad and foreign elements interacting with DPRK.
- Primary targeting: Defectors, Governments

## APT38 / TA444 / Bluenoroff

- APT38 is a financially motivated group, known for significant financial compromises and its use of destructive malware against financial institutions. The group has been attributed to sophisticated compromises targeting [Interbank Fund Transfer Systems](https://mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt38-details-on-new-north-korean-regime-backed-threat-group) to steal millions of dollars at a time across multiple countries worldwide. 
- Current activity from this group is conducted by associated subgroups. Mandiant identified a long hiatus of activity attributed to APT38, which may be indicative of modifications and regrouping of APT38 operators to other units aligned with new priorities and needs.
- APT38 is characterized by long planning, extended periods of access to compromised victim environments preceding any attempts to steal money, fluency across mixed operating system environments, the use of custom developed tools, and a constant effort to thwart investigations capped with a willingness to completely destroy compromised machines afterwards.
- Primary targeting: Financials

## APT43 / Emerald Sleet / Kimsuky

- aka: THALLIUM
-  This group conducts intelligence collection and has used cybercrime to fund espionage.
- APT43 is a prolific cyber operator that directly supports intelligence gathering interests of the North Korean regime. The group combines moderately sophisticated technical capabilities with aggressive social engineering tactics, especially against South Korean and US-based government organizations, academics, and think tanks focused on Korean peninsula geopolitical issues. 
- This organization acts as an intelligence arm and seeming embassy replacement for the RGB and DPRK leadership writ large.
- Primary targeting: Governments, Nuclear, Foreign Relations
- Attribution: Mandiant has tracked this group since 2018, and APT43’s collection priorities align with the mission of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB, North Korea's main foreign intelligence service.
- Activity: APT43 steals and launders enough cryptocurrency to buy operational infrastructure in a manner aligned with North Korea’s juche state ideology of self-reliance, therefore reducing fiscal strain on the central government.
- Tactics: The group creates numerous spoofed and fraudulent (but convincing personas for use in social engineering
- Procedures: APT43 buys hash rental and cloud mining services to provide hash power, which is used to mine cryptocurrency to a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based association to the buyer’s original payments—in other words, they use stolen crypto to mine for clean crypto.

## Hybrid Operations & UNC2226

- Mandiant has observed operations that include tactics and tools from multiple groups, which suggests that in certain cases, operations may be undertaken by multiple groups that fluidly perform ad hoc tasks in support of another group, or due to temporary tasking. This is consistent with public reporting that identified a [group](https://dailynk.com/english/kim-jong-un-directly-handling-results-new-covid-19-hacking-organization-work/) that aligns with an alleged RGB Bureau, designated ‘325’, which was publicly announced in January 2021, when the structure of the RGB likely shifted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Mandiant assesses that UNC2226 is one of the collections of activity supporting the aforementioned mission. UNC2226, like other seemingly ad hoc created efforts, appears to have changed or even expanded targeting to fulfill intelligence gathering efforts. Other clusters, such as UNC3782, have a similar composition and are focused on cryptocurrency theft among other seemingly ad hoc tasks.
- The operations initially appeared to focus almost exclusively on intelligence gathering operations against COVID-19 research and vaccine development/manufacturing organizations. Over time, Mandiant perceived these operations shift from strictly COVID-19 efforts to the targeting of defectors, defense and governments, bloggers, media, cryptocurrency services, and financial institutions.

## Rustbucket

- MacOS Malware
- Malware type: Backdoor
- Group: SquidSquad / Sapphire Sleet
- First seen: 2023
- RustBucket is macOS malware first reported in 2023. Since then, multiple variants of the malware have been observed in the wild. Most RustBucket infections are composed of three stages.
- The first stage usually is an AppleScript file contained inside an application or inside a ZIP archive masquerading as a legitimate file. This AppleScript file is responsible for retrieving the second stage downloader.
- The second stage downloader masquerades as a PDF viewer application. Some variants of this second stage downloader are written in Swift, while others are written in Objective-C.
- The third stage is the final payload retrieved by the second stage downloader. Figure 2 shows an alert from Cortex XDR that blocks a RustBucket sample from downloading the next stage of malware.
- The third stage payloads are Mach-O binaries written in Rust, hence the name RustBucket. Later variants of stage three employ persistence via a LaunchAgent, a feature that did not exist in older variants. 
- Stage three has two main commands: Download and execute a file and self-terminate the malware

- [Apr 2023 | BlueNoroff APT group targets macOS with ‘RustBucket’ Malware](https://jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-apt-targets-macos-rustbucket-malware/)



## Kandykorn
- macOS
- Malware type: Backdoor
- Group: SquidSquad / Sapphire Sleet
- First seen: 2023
- First discovered in 2023, KANDYKORN is the payload of a five-stage infection chain targeting macOS systems. Known infections of KANDYKORN start with social engineering, tricking the victim into downloading a malicious ZIP archive containing a malicious Python script. If the victim executes the Python file, it downloads stage two of the infection, which is a second Python script that is saved into a folder named _log.
- The second stage of the infection involves two additional Python scripts. The first Python script saved to the _log directory downloads another script saved to the /Users/Shared/ directory, which in turn downloads a stage three file, saving it as /Users/shared/.sld.
- Stage three of the infection is a downloader and loader dubbed SUGARLOADER. For persistence, SUGARLOADER saves itself as /Users/shared/.log.
- Upon execution, SUGARLOADER checks for the existence of a configuration file at /Library/Caches/com.apple.safari.ck. If that configuration file is missing, SUGARLOADER downloads it using a default IP address provided in the command line.
- The configuration file at /Library/Caches/com.apple.safari.ck contains the location to download the next stage from. In Figure 3, we see part of a Cortex XDR alert that reveals the installation of this configuration file.



## SmoothOperator
- macOs
- Malware type: Backdoor
- Group: Undetermined, under RGB
- First seen: 2023
- In the beginning of 2023, multiple vendors discovered Trojanized macOS installers for the legitimate 3CX client application known as [3CXDesktopApp](https://3cx.com/user-manual/installation-windows/). These Trojanized installers contained multi-staged malware called [SmoothOperator](https://sentinelone.com/blog/smoothoperator-ongoing-campaign-trojanizes-3cx-software-in-software-supply-chain-attack/).
- SmoothOperator can execute payloads and extract data related to 3CX from infected hosts. It is written in Objective-C and targets 64-bit Intel-based macOS users.
- The Trojanized component of SmoothOperator inside the 3CXDesktopApp application is a module called libffmpeg.dylib, which is a legitimate dependency that appears to have been altered or tampered with by the threat actors. The main purpose of this tampered libffmpeg.dylib file is to collect the infected device’s environment information and to deliver additional payloads.
- When downloading an additional payload, the module writes the payload into a file named UpdateAgent and executes it. Below, Figure 7 shows disassembled code from a tampered libffmpeg.dylib file related to saving the follow-up payload as UpdateAgent.
- UpdateAgent collects the victim's 3CX account information, then it removes itself. The relatively limited capabilities of UpdateAgent likely prevent it from deploying a wide variety of payloads, and we have only noted SmoothOperator as the final payload from this infection chain. Figure 8 shows a Cortex XDR alert detecting a 3CX desktop app for SmoothOperator.


## ObjCShellz
- Malware type: Backdoor
- Group: SquidSquad / Sapphire Sleet
- First seen: 2023
- OS type: macOS
- ObjCShellz is a relatively simple backdoor [Jamf Threat Labs discovered and named in November 2023](https://jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-strikes-again-with-new-macos-malware/). It serves as a remote shell and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Attackers reportedly deliver ObjCShellz as a second stage payload to an already compromised system.
- Like other macOS malware, ObjCShellz is written in Objective-C. Jamf Threat Labs reported attackers using it as a part of the RustBucket campaign. Figure 9 below shows a Cortex XDR alert detecting a sample of ObjCShellz.
