### Other Notes:

There was also a November 2022 Ankr Hack:

- Ankr is a project based on the Binance Smart Chain.  

- In November 2022, an attacker drained over $5 million in tokens from the Ankr project via a private key leak, but the damage didnâ€™t stop there.  

- A follow-on attack against Helio netted an attacker approximately $19 million in stolen tokens.

- The project was in the midst of an update process in which they were changing the models for their reward-bearing and earning tokens to benefit the community.

- During this update process, the private key used to govern contract updates was compromised and used by an attacker.  

- With this key, the attacker was able to update the contract to a malicious, attacker-controlled version.  

- This new contract removed access controls for the contractâ€™s mint function, allowing the attacker to mint 60 trillion aBNBc tokens, worth over $5 million in total.
