## Details

A single private key to a "solver" was compromised. 

The solver is the one that processes all the transactions. It's key lives on servers and in code and stuff.

Root cause malware, obviously. Exact which type of malware and which idiot on the team of idiots ran the malware is TBD.

The team has publicly taken the stance that it was a "3rd party"

Spoiler: it was not a "3rd party" they just realized they fucked up bc this hack reveals they are a fully centralized and personally processing transactions, a vast amount of which are threat actors laundering money.
