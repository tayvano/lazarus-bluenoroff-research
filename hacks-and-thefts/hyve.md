## Details


"Myron Manuirirangi" - persona who initially reached out to team.

"Eduardo Morales Cortes" - https://github.com/eduales99/eduales99 - https://linkedin.com/in/eduardo-morales-cort%C3%A9s-3263761a2/ - also a member of the malicous github and a developer Myron wanted to introduce the team to.

Day 1: "Myron" contacted two technical members of the team via Linkedin separately to ask for development work to be done for him.

Day 2-4: Team members spoke with Myron about the project and issue. He blocked them all after the hack.

Day 5: "Myron" asked one of the team members to give him his Github username so that "Myron" could add said team member to the repo he needed assistance with. The team member directed him to the Technical Lead as the Technical Lead was better equipped to assist. "Myron" then talked with Technical Lead and gave the Technical Lead access to the (malicious) repo.

Day 6: The Technical Lead set up the repo and ran the program to look through it and see what kind of help he needed. He sent messages to "Myron" but "Myron" never responded. The hack happened that night.

The Technical Lead's device was compromised via this malicious github repo and various private keys were compromised. This allowed the attacker to upgrade one of the HYVE contracts and add a withdrawTokens() function.

‚ùó NOTE: /otrinsanity/ appears to be a legit person that the hacker was impersonating / had cloned the profile of. Screenshots shared by the team of the DM's show "Linkedin Member" with no profile photo, indicating that the exact profile used has been taken down. NO WITCHHUNTS OF LEGIT PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
