A person named Alia Milano contacted me on LinkedIn, claiming to be a recruiter seeking a developer for a project called UltraX Dex. She shared a task list for the role, and after I confirmed that the tasks were manageable, she invited me to review the project and schedule a meeting with the tech lead, Silas Monteiro.

## Interview Process
Milano invited me to review the project code on GitHub for UltraX-Dex. During the interview, the tech lead requested that I clone and run the project, suggest optimizations, and provide feedback on the task list. Due to difficulties in running the project, the tech lead suggested a 20-minute break to consult with his team. Upon resuming the call, he shared a link to a proof of concept and asked me to navigate through it and provide suggestions for improvement.

## Suspicious Activity
While interacting with the proof of concept, I noticed something unusual: my MetaMask wallet was unlocked without my authorization. Upon checking, I discovered that my entire wallet had been emptied, resulting in a theft of 13,750 USDC (approximately 13,060 Euros). I have reported this theft to the wallet provider.

## Aftermath
Immediately after the interview, both the recruiter and tech lead blocked me on all communication channels, preventing any further contact. A police complaint has been filed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with an appointment scheduled for December 13, 2024, to submit all evidence related to this incident.

I work at web3 and recently got laid off. I was looking for a job and I was approached from a person from Linked In.

We decided to have a interview and during the interview, CTO was trying to demo his dApp which required a wallet connect. I used my metamask brainlessly and suddenly he was dropped from the call (google hangout) and did not come back.

I just thought he had bad connection and tried to reach via Linked In but account became in-activate. (Even until this point, I wasn't sure what is going on)

When I check my Metamask wallet, that's when I realise my assets were all gone

# Report 3

- I was contacted on LinkedIn for a job opportunity by an individual who claimed to be a business representative. 

- They gave me a small development task and later they askewd me to connect my Metamask wallet in order to assess the current website that they have developed (website no longer functional and accessible). 

- I can only assume that they figured out a way to sign transactions via the fake website while I was connected with my wallet. 

- I lost all my assets (around $2500 in the Linea network) due to my naive nature and because I really thought this was an interview process.
