### Details

> On September 27th around 2am Eastern Time, an unauthorized actor gained access to my 1Password account, which contained several seed phrases for my self-custodied cryptocurrency wallets.

> The credentials for 1Password were not stored elsewhere, nor shared with any third party.

> In the middle of the night, the attacker changed the recovery email associated with the 1Password account, then used the exposed seed phrases to drain multiple wallets across chains.

> Within minutes, the funds were transferred through a sequence of addresses that appear to have been pre-prepared for the attack.

> My centralized exchange and traditional finance accounts were protected by two-factor authentication and were not compromised, despite the attacker's attempt.

> The total loss is approximately USD 700,000, primarily consisting of USDC and other major tokens.

> Given the nature and timing of the breach, it appears to be a targeted intrusion rather than a random phishing event.
