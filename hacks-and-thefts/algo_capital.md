## Details

Algo Capital, an investment firm focused on the Algorand blockchain, lost a few million dollars in USDT and ALGO tokens after its chief technology officer's phone was breached.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Algo Capital reported to its limited partners Friday that Pablo Yabo, its CTO, had his mobile phone compromised, which allowed attackers to seize control of an Algo hot wallet he administered. As a result of the breach, roughly $1 million to $2 million in the cryptocurrencies were taken.

Algo Capital has raised $200 million for its Algo VC Fund, with the cash intended to support projects in the Algorand economy. Algo Capital founder and managing partner Arul Murugan said in an August 2019 statement that:

> "Our investment approach specifically targets companies that are creating the next great blockchain applications and infrastructure solutions, and as a result, helping to speed blockchain adoption and bring millions of new users into the Algorand network."

The investment firm is a separate entity from the Algorand Foundation and Algorand LLC, which oversee the blockchain's actual development. 

Pablo Yabo has resigned his position, according to the email sent to partners. Further security measures have been taken by the firm. The majority of the firm's funds were held in cold wallets that were not compromised.

The firm is taking full responsibility for the loss and committed to reimbursing the full amount within 20 months. "We are engaging with certain key organizations and security services to collaborate and address this issue which has become a common industry problem," Garcia wrote.



## "Inside Job"

Not an Inside Job but CTO Pablo Yabo still blamed, resigned via terse Medium post as a result.

> This unfortunate event has incited much reflection on my part. The incident made me think thoroughly about the state of the ecosystem and the difficulties to secure and operate funds while doing it in a versatile manner.

> Therefore, I have decided to focus entirely on [Randlabs.io](https://web.archive.org/web/20191225213958/https://randlabs.io/) to do what I love most: build tools and software that increases the adoption of blockchain technology.

Note: [Randlabs is the company that built / builds MyAlgo. 😬](https://cryptoslate.com/algorand-blasted-over-inaction-on-ongoing-wallet-drain-hack/)

UPDATE (Oct. 7, 01:40 UTC):  Yabo pledged in a Medium post published Sunday to shoulder most of the reimbursement cost, writing:

> "I take responsibility for this and thus will be personally covering most of the stolen funds and the rest will be covered by Algo Capital General Partners."

> Yabo also confirmed his departure from Algo Capital in the post. "I have decided to focus entirely on Randlabs.io to do what I love most: build tools and software that increases the adoption of blockchain technology," he wrote.



## In US v. 280 Virtual Currency Accounts

Defendant Property 25 through Defendant Property 280

“Exchange 10” is a U.S.-based company focused on the Algorand blockchain, which administers ALGO tokens, a form of virtual currency. On or about September 25, 2019, Algo Capital was the victim of a theft of multiple virtual currencies in which hackers used stolen recovery seeds to recreate wallets owned by Algo Capital and its partners, including “Algo Capital Partner 1” and “Algo Capital Partner 2.”

By re-creating the wallets, the hackers were able to direct the transfer of funds out of the wallets into other addresses and wallets controlled by the hackers, thereby stealing the virtual currency from Algo Capital and its individual partners. Additionally, hackers gained access to Algo Capital-owned accounts at multiple other virtual currency exchanges. In all, the security incident resulted in the theft of the following:

One of the first accounts (Defendant Property 110) at Exchange 11 to receive the stolen ALGO was registered in the name of a U.S. Citizen (“IDT Victim 1”) on or about September 26, 2019. A selfie-style photo and a photo of IDT Victim 1’s biographical U.S. passport page were submitted to Exchange 11. The account had only one deposit, approximately 80,000 stolen ALGO.

In an interview with law enforcement, IDT Victim 1 verified that he or she did not open the account in question at Exchange 11. The photos submitted to Exchange 11 were likely stolen during the 2018 hack of a U.S.-based crypto currency exchange where IDT Victim 1 was a customer.

The ALGO tokens sent to Defendant Property 25 through Defendant Property 130 were promptly converted into BTC. Of that BTC, approximately 208.1268 BTC were withdrawn to four BTC clusters, which contained addresses enumerated as “Defendant Property 131” through “Defendant Property 163.” One of the four clusters, a cluster starting with bc1qns6q7 (containing the addresses enumerated as Defendant Property 147 through Defendant Property 163), also received the stolen approximately 19.69 BTC from Algo Capital Partner 1’s Trezor wallet2 (line number 3 in the above chart).

Algo Capital Partner 2 owned two accounts (“Defendant Property 164” and “Defendant Property 165”) at Exchange 11. Algo Capital Partner 2 funded both accounts exclusively by ALGO tokens received prior to the hack.

After the hack on September 30, 2019, these two accounts sent approximately 1.9995 BTC to a BTC cluster starting with bc1qkr8m4 (containing addresses enumerated as “Defendant Property 166” through “Defendant Property 168”) (line number 6 in the chart above).

On the same day, approximately 15 minutes later, one of the two accounts attempted to send approximately 1.9995 BTC to cluster bc1qkr8m4 (line number 9 in the above chart), but Exchange 11 canceled the transaction. Cluster bc1qkr8m4 sent BTC to one of the four previously mentioned BTC clusters that received the BTC from Exchange 11 and contained Defendant Property 131 through Defendant Property 134.

Algo Capital Partner 1’s account at Exchange 11 sent the stolen 144,363.89 USDT to another account (“Defendant Property 169”) at Exchange 11 (line number 4 in the above chart).

59. The stolen 194,591.33 USDT from Algo Capital’s Trezor wallet (line number 2 in the above chart) and the stolen 33.12 ETH from Algo Capital Partner 1’s account at Exchange 11 (line number 7 in the above chart) were both sent to the same address starting with 0x8bB (“Defendant Property 170”). Then the stolen USDT and ETH was sent to 0x742B115424Ccda93d9228cA9aa56ec2442b94CA9 (“Defendant Property 171”). The stolen 1,931.74 USDT from Algo Capital’s account (line number 8 in the above chart) was sent to an intermediary address before being sent to Defendant Property 171 as well. From Defendant Property 171, the ETH and USDT were sent to another virtual asset service provider.

The Algo Capital Partner 1’s account at Exchange 11 also sent approximately 2.0285 BTC to an account at another exchange (“Exchange 12”) (line number 5 in the chart above).

C. Connections of Hack of Exchange 11 to Hack of Exchange 3 and North Korea - (Defendant Property 172 through Defendant Property 280) 

As previously stated, the stolen ALGO tokens were deposited into 106 different accounts at Exchange 11, converted to BTC, and withdrawn to four BTC clusters (shown below, in light green lines). 

These four clusters are connected via cluster 1LEvp (containing “Defendant Property 172” through “Defendant Property 280”) to cluster 1BHnp (containing Defendant Property 8 through Defendant Property 22), which was involved in the laundering of the stolen funds from the Exchange 3 theft as described above.

Cluster 1LEvp (containing Defendant Property 172 through Defendant Property 280) is also connected to BTC addresses previously named in the above-referenced forfeiture complaint, __see __1:20-cv-00606-TJK, and attributed to thefts by North Korea. In spite of the actors’ use of VPN services to mask their location during this theft, law enforcement was able to trace logins to an IP address within North Korea.

Ultimately the funds from the thefts of Exchange 3, Algo Capital, and the recent thefts attributed to North Korea, __see __1:20-cv-00606-TJK, were laundered, at least in part, by the same Chinese OTC traders operating at Exchange 6 as illustrated above in the Venn diagram. Notably, there are three OTC trader accounts that received funds from each of the three events.

The addresses contained in cluster bc1qhmv7k (Defendant Property 147 through Defendant Property 156) received BTC from Exchange 11. Cluster bc1qhmv7k funded an account at a U.S.-based domain registrar (“Domain Registrar 1”) that registered “Website 1” on or about September 26, 2019. The same day, approximately 62 new accounts at Exchange 11 registered with Website 1 email accounts began receiving ALGO stolen from Algo Capital. The username portion of the Website 1 email addresses appear to be a random string of characters, as if automatically generated.

IP addresses logging into this Domain Registrar 1 account resolve to a VPN service. Target Actor 1 was paying for services at this same VPN service with stolen BTC.
