## Details II

- I do freelance software development work through the company Braintrust (www.usebraintrust.com).
- Braintrust is a legitimate service that connects clients with freelance software developers and handles communication, contracts, and payments/billing.
- I have worked successfully for clients before on Braintrust. I received an invite to apply for a job offer through Braintrust (note, I actively received the invite to apply from Braintrust via email - I was the 'passive party' and did not go searching for this job).
- I completed the job application and communicated with the client over the Braintrust platform.
- As part of the job application process I downloaded the code they shared to my laptop to see what I would be working on.
- This code was actually hidden obfuscated malware and infected my laptop.
- I deleted everything I could find and quarantined the laptop by turning off the internet connection, unfortunately it was too late.
- All my crypto funds in my crypto wallet have been drained to the attacker by their malware as it has found and transmitted my private keys/seed phrase.
- I don't know how they found it I am always very tight on digital hygiene and the only private key in plaintext was in .env files for my separate dev wallet that only contained $14 of gas tokens.
- In the current market this stolen crypto is worth roughly $12,600

## Details V

- Recently, I received an invitation for interview on Upwork regarding a job post: https://upwork.com/jobs/~01fb0cb0025d35d158
- As mentioned in the job post, it's an ongoing project. So, as usual, the client sent me the repo of the project: https://bitbucket.org/juandsuareza/main/src/main/
- And, sent me a screen-recording (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLLOF56mFkVf-GZbTxKXZlHXNAFUkgGy/view?usp=sharing) pointing-out to the bug/issue in the existing project, and asked me whether I'm also facing the same after running the project locally.
- As, you can see, the repo doesn't look suspicious at all (especially in the eyes of regular devs). So, I cloned the repo and started executing it locally. Once, it started running on localhost, it was opening like a normal Next.js app on browser. Trust me, everything was completely unsuspicious.
- However, here comes the twist, all of a sudden, it started asking for permissions of accessing browser cache, notes, reminders and what not. And to be very honest, i denied all of them as it started looking a lot suspicious all of a sudden. And I closed and deleted the project completely. Suddenly checked my bank accounts and all using my phone via dedicated banking apps (as I never access any of my bank account via browser or laptop).
- But then, when I checked my Metamask, all of my funds on all the mainnet accounts were gone. Luckily, I was/am not holding any crypto for investment purposes or so, whatever was there of around $60 was for various testing purposes, mainly in Polygon MATIC. These were the transactions that happened:

- https://etherscan.io/tx/0x44ce9e9a00d802c85875e5a76a65b14236d1e744f9d60ad1a1008ebe7e5dc134
- Funny enough, in the second transaction, you guys can see the scammer has spent around $4 in transaction fees to transfer $1 worth of Ethereum. Clearly, not an expert scammer for sure!
