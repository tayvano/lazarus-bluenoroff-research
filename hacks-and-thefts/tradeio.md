## Details

Trade.io, a Swiss blockchain company that advertises itself as a “next-generation financial institution”, has been hacked. According to an announcement from the firm, 50 million Trade Tokens (TIO), which is the company’s own cryptocurrency, have been stolen. These are worth approximately $7.5 million at the current price, but closer to $11 million at the time of the hack a few hours ago.

The stolen tokens were intended to be used as a project’s liquidity pool. Therefore, the management performed a fork to get the funds back. Interestingly enough the team stored the wallet itself in a local bank’s deposit safe. And since it was reported that the safe wasn’t compromised the only explanation is that hackers somehow managed to access the wallet details for making the transfers, that normally indicates an ^^“Inside Job”^^

Trade.io states: “We use industry recommended cold storage which are maintained in safety deposit boxes in banks, along with all corresponding materials. We have confirmed that the safety deposit boxes were not compromised.””
