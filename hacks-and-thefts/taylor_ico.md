## Details

The cryptocurrency trading platform Taylor suffered a robbery where the hacker stole all of the 2,579.98 ETH ($1.35 million) raised by the project during its recently conducted ICO along with native TAY tokens. 

There were concerns that this was just another Inside Job, but it appears that Taylor has slowly managed to rebuild.  The cryptocurrency trading platform Taylor suffered a robbery where the hacker stole all of the 2,579.98 ETH ($1.35 million) raised by the project during its recently conducted ICO along with native TAY tokens. The Taylor team also suspected the hacker attempted to launder the stolen funds by dumping the tokens on the IDEX platform. 

The Taylor team also suspected the hacker attempted to launder the stolen funds by dumping the tokens on the IDEX platform.  Consequently, they instructed **IDEX** to temporarily delist TAY tokens.

Several indicators point them towards a group of hackers that hacked another project dubbed **Cypherium** for more than 17,000 ETH (about $9.8 million).

Not only the balance in ETH (2,578.98 ETH), but also the TAY tokens from the Team and Bounty pools

The only tokens that were not stolen are the ones from the Foundersâ€™ and Advisorsâ€™ pools, because thereâ€™s a vesting contract making them inaccessible for now.
