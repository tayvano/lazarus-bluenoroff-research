> Dear AIO Community Members and Token Holders,

> On September 1, 2025, at 2:59 PM (UTC+8), OlaXBT detected suspicious activity involving unauthorized withdrawals of approximately 32 million AIO tokens from multisig wallets.

> Immediately upon detection, we activated our emergency response protocols, engaged BlockSec and other leading cybersecurity experts, and worked closely with our exchange partners to secure all systems and mitigate market volatility. The identified wallet vulnerability has been fully resolved, and operations remain stable.

> Based on blockchain forensics and preliminary investigations, the exploit appears to involve sophisticated techniques that we are actively tracing through transaction patterns and wallet interactions. Our team, in collaboration with cybersecurity firms, has uncovered evidence of coordinated unauthorized access, and we are now coordinating with global law enforcement agencies to pursue legal action and assist in recovery efforts.

> To protect our community and ensure fairness, we are developing a compensation plan for all verified AIO holders who held tokens prior to the incident. Details, including the snapshot block, eligibility criteria, and distribution timeline, will be announced in a follow-up post after consultation with auditors to maintain integrity and transparency.

> Your trust and support remain our top priority. The OlaXBT team is determined to emerge stronger from this challenge, with an unwavering commitment to user asset protection, transparency, and long-term project integrity.

> Thank you for your vigilance and continued confidence.

> The OlaXBT Project Team
