## Details

Private Key Compromise

Cypherium telegram group admins deleted and banned users mentioning it.

Nate (exec at cypherium) confirmed in telegram chat that there was a security breach, (also said FBI was involved to some people and to some other he said their lawfirm was)  BUT later he deleted pms.

Before the hack they offered refunds to possible investors (for other non related issues) which some investors said they'd want. But they weren't able to fulfil all those refunds since they got hacked in the process it seems

The total amount raised/hard cap during private sale was $25M however at the time of the presale ETH did go up to $1000+. The hacker seems to have sweeped 17k ETH to & from here 0xbc3175b1054214acea52127f3de1b7b243844670]]
