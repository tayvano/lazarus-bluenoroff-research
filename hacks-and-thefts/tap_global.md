# Tap.global

Date:: August 29th, 2020

## Details

> So another Canadian exchange appears to have been hacked a couple months ago. Hasn't been publicly reported yet. 

> 8.33 BTC stolen from Coinberry's hot wallet & sent to 1KcTk7kJMjYaCV3FXo5bzpjaZs2aK18ntz.

> The hacker appears to have stolen funds from Tap[.]global just a few days later as well on 8/29

> It's also the same actor that funds from Coinmetro. That's just based on the Onchain evidence we can see after a 2 minute peek. The reality is the majority of custodial exchanges & services don't take their security services, at least not until after they're hacked.
