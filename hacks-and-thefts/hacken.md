## Details

The recent attack on Hacken's $HAI token infrastructure appears to stem from a compromised private key associated with the deployer wallet used for bridge operations between the Ethereum and BNB networks. This private key compromise allowed the attacker unauthorized access, enabling them to mint a massive 900 million $HAI tokens across both networks. The root cause has been linked to weaknesses in the security architecture of the original bridge deployment, which lacked modern safety standards and relied on an outdated design due to its early development phase.

Once the attacker gained control of the deployer wallet, they executed multiple minting transactions to inflate the token supply illegitimately. On the BNB Chain, they were able to convert a portion of the illicitly minted tokens‚Äîapproximately $253,000‚Äîinto liquid assets. The limited liquidity in the $HAI pools restricted the attacker‚Äôs ability to extract more funds, containing some of the damage. Verified transactions showing these mint events can be found on both BscScan and Etherscan.
