Malicious MetaMask, Private Key Compromise

From: Dan @ Pantera Capital

Subject: Pantera Capital Investment Agreement (Protected)

Ankitt Gaur, founder and CEO of Layer 2 DeFi lending protocol EasyFi (EASY), said, 

> â€œOn April 19, team members reported that a large number of EASY tokens were transferred from the official EasyFi wallet to the Ethereum network and several unknowns on the Polygon network

> The hacker successfully obtained the administrator key and transferred $6 million of existing liquid funds in the form of USD/DAI/USDT from the protocol pool, and transferred 298 Ten thousand EASY tokens (approximately 30% of the total supply of EASY tokens, currently valued at 40.9 million U.S

> By stealing the private keys to EasyFiâ€™s MetaMask admin account, hackers were able to extract $6M in USD, DAI, and USDT, plus 2.98M EASY tokens, all of which amounted to around $81M 

> The machine that was compromised to gain the keys was offline most of the time, only being switched on to perform official transfers for the project 

> When the attack was carried out, the machine had been offline for more than a week And because it wasnâ€™t actively used when the attack was carried out, this delayed the platformâ€™s response and allowed the hacker to drain the assets from the protocol. get access to admin keys and remove existing liquidity to the tune of $6 million from protocol pools in USD / DAI / USDT and transfer 2.98 Million EASY tokens.

> While most metamask attacks phish private keys / mnemonic phrases by tricking into downloading a malicious version, this is not the case here 

> My computer was compromised and MetaMask was altered from the disk 

> The physical machine was not tampered with, and it seems to be the issue with some remote access as might have been previously used on Hugh Karp 

> From the initial investigations, it looks like hackers are extremely sophisticated and quite likely working as part of a larger group."

The token was upgraded to â€˜EZ 2.0â€™ four days later, making the hackerâ€™s existing EASY holdings useless .
