## Details

Wallet used to upgrade smart contracts used to steal $23M

At the beginning of July 2018, hackers attempted to steal $23.5 million in cryptocurrency from the ‘decentralized’ crypto exchange Bancor and got away with $13M. The attempt included $12.5 million in Ethereum along with BNT and NPXS tokens totaling $11 million. Bancor was able to block the transfer of $10M of BNT, Bancor’s native digital currency. This security breach forced the firm to shut down operations. Bancor had been one of the more high-profile Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) of 2017, raking in $153 million during its token sale event. According to Bancor, a wallet used to update some smart contracts was breached and used to withdraw the cryptocurrency.

Bancor immediately created a coalition with Changelly, through which the hackers tried to withdraw funds. Transactions were frozen there as well.

At 00:00 UTC, Bancor experienced a security breach. A wallet used to upgrade some smart contracts was compromised. This compromised wallet was then used to withdraw ETH from the BNT smart contract in the amount of 24,984 ETH (~~$12.5M). The same wallet also stole 229,356,645 NPXS (~~$1M) and 3,200,000 BNT (~$1oM). Once the theft was identified, Bancor was able to freeze the stolen BNT, limiting the damage to the Bancor ecosystem from the theft. It is not possible to freeze the ETH or any other stolen tokens. Primary analysis shows this wallet address and the transaction hash that led to the breach. 22,000 ETH were transferred for a transaction cost of just $0.88 at 61 GWEI. Read the official statement [here](https://twitter.com/Bancor/status/1016420621666963457).

$10m worth of BNT was later recovered. 

A Bancor wallet got hacked and that wallet has the ability to steal coins out of their own smart contracts. An exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds OR if it can freeze customer funds. Bancor can do BOTH. It’s a false sense of decentralization.
