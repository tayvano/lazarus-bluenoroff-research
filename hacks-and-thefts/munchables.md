## Details

Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person as they:

- recommended each other for the job 

- regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses >funded each others wallets

> The Munchables case is unusual, as probable DPRK IT workers stole and ultimately returned cryptocurrency due to operational impediments they faced in the laundering process. On March 26, 2024, according to a private sector partner, DPRK IT workers appeared to exploit the blockchain-based NFT game Munchables on the Blast blockchain, leading to the theft of approximately 17,413.96 ETH, valued at $62.5 million at the time of the attack. 

> Industry sources confirmed that an anonymous insider, a DPRK developer, carried out the exploit. Despite the initial success, the DPRK insider was only able to cash out $6,220 worth of ETH using a MEXC (a cryptocurrency exchange) deposit address. The following day, March 27, 2024, after conversations with the Blast blockchain creator who goes by Pacman, the hackers returned the funds to a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by core Blast contributors 105 [wallet address: 0x4D2F75F1cF76C8689b4FDdCF4744A22943c6048C (0x4D2F)], bridging an additional $3,740 worth of ETH back to the Blast blockchain and sending it to the same contract. 

> The Blast team worked with Munchables to return recovered funds to the affected users. The movement of funds is displayed in Image 1. Approximately thirty minutes after the initial theft, the attackers extracted an additional 73.49 ETH, indicating continued access to compromised systems and a well-coordinated operation with intimate knowledge of the target infrastructure. The compromise involved manipulating proxy contract implementations within the Munchables ecosystem. The IT worker hackers used a multi-phase approach: first, a reconnaissance phase to gain insider access to the Munchables developer team; second, preparing the infrastructure by updating proxy contract implementations with malicious code; and third, systematically draining available ETH and WETH from target contracts. Finally, they attempted to move stolen assets through cross-chain transfer operations. 

> However, they lacked the sophistication to efficiently launder the funds off the Blast network, which likely contributed to the return of the funds to the Munchables team. The hackers faced significant operational challenges when attempting to transfer stolen assets off the Blast network. Third-party bridge services imposed liquidity-based transfer limits, restricting transactions to a maximum of 3 ETH. These limitations severely hindered their ability to quickly move large volumes, forcing a time-consuming process that increased their exposure to detection and intervention. While Blast’s native bridge infrastructure had no volume limits, it required a 14-day withdrawal waiting period, which offered insufficient operational security for the hackers. Third-party bridges, though faster, had substantial volume restrictions that proved problematic for large asset transfers. 

> The hackers were likely insufficiently prepared for efficient laundering following the initial hack, and their expertise lay more with smart contract development than with on-chain laundering. Cross-chain transfer attempts initiated within two minutes of the attack suggest an improvised rather than planned methodology, and subsequent attempts demonstrated a limited understanding of bridge infrastructure constraints
