## Details

Persona: Fake [Rena](./rena.md) (Stacks ecosystem)

> Got targeted AGAIN on my workstation. 
> Noticed a weird pop up which I dismissed. Immediately heard the Finder “download” sound (like you hear when copying files). 
> “That’s weird”
> Saw a pop-up - my entire documents folder being copied to a new folder /tmp
> “What?”
> Ran a quick script to see what was running  - someone had full remote access of my computer and had a copy script running. 
> Immediately disconnected from internet and did a full check. A osascript running from my terminal, copy files into Library/Caches then probably upload. 
> Insane. No idea how - could be anything from telegram/iMessage auto-download or worse. 
> My documents folder on desktop syncs to iCloud which has sensitive stuff. 
> Be super careful out there. At this point it’s not a matter of if - but when you will be targeted. 
> I did a full reset of my mac back to reset and will probably disable iCloud document syncing now. 
> Luckily I do not have private keys - only use  @vultisig so I’m safe even if I use iCloud to store one of 3 vault shares. 
> Be safe out there!

> After being targeted TWICE now
> I am absolutely convinced that you are insane if you are still using private keys. 
> Scammers will use AI agents at scale to target you and try and sniff those keys. 
> Vultisig is the correct solution (security through multi-factor) and I’m going to double down on it. 
> Been spiking the SDK to make it even easier to get Vultisig everywhere.

> finally tracked down the source of the attack
> friend's hacked telegram account with a zoom link.
> Note: this is the OFFICIAL zoom link and I joined IN THE browser. I literally saw a deep fake of my friend, but couldn't hear anything so dropped off and tried on google meets. 
> INSANE - in 2 mins on being on the OFFICIAL zoom link - they had downloaded a malicious script to my computer and begun copying my entire iCloud documents folder to /tmp and probably to upload. 
> DO NOT USE ZOOM!!!!!!

> Ok so this attack finally manifested itself. 
> Had an old metamask cleaned out (which I forgot about, it was staking some assets which don’t appear on etherscan unless you use portfolio tracking sites)
> Summary 
> 1) friend’s hacked telegram account + deep-fake video on zoom
> 2) fake zoom link (likely) 
> 3) No pop-ups whilst I was on the link for 2 mins. 
> 4) Metamask was not being used in chrome for the active user - it was in another logged-out user profile (mac)
> 5) The metamask key was also stored in my iCloud Keychain 
> So I’m not sure if they were able to read across into the other user chrome profile (the active user had sudo priv) OR they fully swiped my (encrypted) iCloud Keychain. 
> There was no pop-ups asking for me to install anything or input my admin password. 
> It has to be an active or recently patched 0-day. 
> The only solution for this is threshold signature wallets - where key shares are split between multiple devices and you have to always co-sign. 
> Frustrating but I am deeply resolved to continue fixing and building @vultisig

> It was a 8-year old metamask that has lived on there since the start. I don't use metamask any more, completely forgot I even had it, but got a notification there was still funds on it. 
> If you can't trust your iCloud Keychain - what can you trust? Do you use 1Password or something else?
> I only use @vultisig now for key shares tho
