### Laundry

Funds from thefts such as CoinMetro, CoinBerry, Unibright, and individuals were transferred through intermediary wallets before consolidating in `0x0864b5ef4d8086cd0062306f39adea5da5bd2603` in early January 2021.

3000 ETH was deposited to Tornado Cash by `0x0864b5ef4d8086cd0062306f39adea5da5bd2603` on January 11, 2021 02:54â€“09:14 UTC.

After 1814.49 ETH was transferred from `0x0864b5ef4d8086cd0062306f39adea5da5bd2603` to `0x1031ffaf5d00c6bc1ee0978eb7ec196b1d164129` and 17 X 100 ETH was deposited to Tornado Cash on January 11,2021.

An additional 112.1 ETH was deposited to Tornado cash by `0x1031ffaf5d00c6bc1ee0978eb7ec196b1d164129` from January 14â€“16, 2021.

45 X 100 ETH was withdrawn from Tornado Cash to `0x05492cbc8fb228103744ecca0df62473b2858810` beginning January 11, 2021 14:35 UTC thru January 14, 2021 23:52 UTC.

All Tornado Cash withdrawals for the month of January 2021 were reviewed and no additional withdrawals were found which shared similar characteristics. Additional comfort is gained with the demix as the Tornado withdrawal destination address connects back with the original theft address.

Through a series of transactions, the funds sitting in `0x05492cbc8fb228103744ecca0df62473b2858810` were transferred through intermediary addresses and consolidated with funds from other Lazarus Group thefts before USDT was deposited to the P2P marketplace Paxful via deposit addresses `0x246569f8b420c8d850c475c53d0d59973b3f08fc` and `0x593dc5e1ad81667bbfc90739dd2c09c926920e3b` beginning in July 2022. 

In April 2023 they began using Noones deposit address `0x2e1155cf5374cba058a04fd03ebd0ba19afe580d`. They continue slowly transferring USDT in batches until November 2023.

Additionally, in 2021 multiple transfers were made from the 0x9973 address to [Wu Huihui](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=42496), a China-based OTC trader. In April 2023, an [indictment against Wu](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-foreign-trade-bank-representative-charged-crypto-laundering-conspiracies) was unsealed alleging that he facilitated payments for DPRK and he was added to the OFAC SDN list.
