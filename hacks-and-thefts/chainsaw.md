## Background

Peplicator and Replicandy were both 24-hour generative NFT minting events created by Matt Furie, leveraging smart contract technology to create unique, 1-of-1 digital collectibles. Technically, both projects operated on a system that allowed users to generate (‚Äúrespin‚Äù) randomized artwork combinations‚Äîbuilt from pre-designed visual layers‚Äîuntil they found a version they wanted to mint. Each final minted NFT was recorded on-chain as a unique asset.

The minting contracts were coded to remain open only during a strict 24-hour window‚ÄîPeplicator from March 8‚Äì9 and Replicandy from June 17‚Äì18. Once this window closed, minting was permanently disabled and the collection supply was locked forever. This time-bound mechanic ensured scarcity and exclusivity, a common practice in generative art drops to maintain long-term value.

## ZachXBT's Thread

1/  Multiple projects tied to Pepe creator Matt Furie & ChainSaw as well as another project Favrr were exploited in the past week which resulted in ~$1M stolen

My analysis links both attacks to the same cluster of DPRK IT workers who were likely accidentally hired as developers.

2/ On Jun 18, 2025 at 4:25 am UTC ownership for ‚ÄòReplicandy‚Äô from Matt Furie & ChainSaw was transferred to a new EOA 0x9Fca.

Jun 18, 2025 6:20 pm UTC: 0x9Fca withdrew mint proceeds from the contract

Jun 19, 2025 5:11 am UTC: 0x9Fca unpauses the mint

The attacker then minted NFTs and sold into bids causing the floor price to fall to zero.

3/ On Jun 23, 2025 the attacker transferred ownership from the ChainSaw deployer to 0x9Fca for Peplicator, Hedz, Zogz.

Similarly the attacker minted NFTs and sold them into bids causing the floor price to fall to zero.

4/ In total I estimate $310K+ from their projects was stolen and transferred primarily between the three address below. 

- 0xf6a9349c54d51f7f76bbd2afd755b5dd75e617ee

- 0x7e580f916a8e93871b72a694407fb7d790de96a6

- 0x58f4299465b261e79713e5c78a7629cd656aed36

5/ The attacker transferred 2.05 ETH to exchange 1 on Jun 18 at 7:47 pm UTC.

By performing a timing analysis I could locate the destination transaction where 5007.91 USDT was received and transferred to MEXC.

- 0xf87fbc5e8fff065b413d3d48932b6fb5585d93d5

6/ Tracing back from the MEXC deposit address 0xf87 revealed many other stablecoin deposits received each month ranging from $2K-10K for various projects.  

As those teams were helpful with providing info and the DPRK ITWs were removed so I will not name the project.

7/ Two GitHub accounts used by suspected DPRK ITWs in this cluster can be seen below and listed wallets on their account.  

- DPRK ITW 1: devmad119 - 0x93d5785d759563b5b8eb98eaff9196dddf7179f3

- DPRK ITW 2: sujitb2114 - 0x6c88dd91de053fca915baece6868f6c32d20adea

8/ Other indicators revealed from internal logs point out irregularities in a suspected DPRK IT workers resume. 

Why would a developer who claims to be living in the US have a Korean language setting, Astral VPN usage, and have an Asia/Russia time zone?

9/ Tracing back from the MEXC deposit 0xf87f lead to another different DPRK ITW consolidation: 

- 0x477d13ee1e1304292d270bfac1aa496902e6851f

10/ DPRK ITW consolidation 0x477 received payroll from the project Favrr which was exploited for $680K+ on June 25, 2025

I suspect they have a second ITW on payroll as well because the exploiter address is tied to a Gate deposit address 0xab7 which ITW 2 sent payroll to. 

- Favrr ITW 1 0x17087f92d16049e9097413b4964663b754c1e43d

- Favrr ITW 2 0x641279133f6f560c3f512b8e2d286ae2c53c31ee

11/ The Favrr CTO Alex Hong has a background which appears suspicious and is likely one of the two DPRK ITWs hired. 

His LinkedIn was very recently deleted. 

I also reached out to a project he supposedly worked at but could not verify his work history.

12/ Soon I plan to publish my stats on total payments being sent out to DPRK ITWs at companies/projects to provide insight into how bad it is. 

It‚Äôs depressing how many teams hire DPRK IT workers when basic due diligence would likely have prevented it.

The lack of communication from Matt Furie & ChainSaw since the incident occurred has been disappointing with their only warning to the community deleted without explanation. 

The stolen funds from the ChainSaw incident mostly remain dormant.

The stolen funds for Favrr were transferred to Gate and a few nested services. 

I have been unable to get in touch with the teams due to DMs disabled and no way to easily contact them on Telegram or Discord.
