## Details


PlayDapp had 200 million unauthorized tokens minted a few hours ago.

The attackers have been moving the funds around and depositing to exchanges that support PLA. If your exchange supports it, you may want to consider temporarily disabling withdrawals as a precaution.

PlayDapp, an Ethereum-based P2E game, was exploited due to compromised private keys, resulting in a loss of 1.79 billion PLA tokens worth around 32,350,000 USD.

PlayDapp, a P2E game running on the Ethereum chain, was exploited two times,between Feb 9-12, 2024. The root cause of the exploit was reportedly due to the compromise of private keys. Before the first exploit transactions, a new minter was added to the PlayDapp: PLA Token.

The attacker minted a total of 1.79 billion PLA tokens in two separate incidents, worth around 287,775,772 USD at the time. However, the attacker was able to convert only 32 million USD. The stolen funds were transferred to various addresses, with some being deposited on the Polygon chain, Binance exchange, and a significant portion remaining in the scammer's address as of Feb 13, 2024. The attacker was funded by FixedFloat. A reward of 1 million USD was offered to the hacker for the immediate return of all stolen contracts and assets.


The South Korean blockchain gaming platform PlayDapp was hacked on February 9, and an attacker minted 200 million $PLA tokens.

These were notionally priced at around $36.5 million, although because only 577 million $PLA were in circulation before the unauthorized mint, there would not have been sufficient liquidity for the attacker to sell them at around that price.

Days after the initial attack, on February 12, the attacker minted another 1.59 billion $PLA. This has led to news reports that the platform was exploited for "$290 million". However, this value is being naively calculated based on the token price without taking into account the massive supply inflation, and ignoring that that dollar figure is more than 2.5x the total claimed market cap of the token. Even reputable outlets like Bleeping Computer have printed the figure in their headline (though Bleeping Computer later changed the headline to a more accurate one).

PlayDapp sent on-chain messages to the attacker, offering a bounty, but the offer was ignored.



> We are writing to inform you of a critical security incident involving the PLA token contract. The PLA token contract has been hacked and additional PLA tokens have been issued. We understand the gravity of this situation and assure you that we are taking immediate action.
