## Details 

A bZx developer was sent a phishing email to his personal computer with a malicious macro in a Word document that was disguised as a legitimate email attachment, which then ran a script on his PC.

The phishing attack was similar to one that affected another user recently named ‚Äúmgnr.io‚Äù and would connect to Bondly Finance hack.

This attack granted the hacker access to the content of the bZx Developers wallet, and also the private keys to the BSC and Polygon deployment of bZx Protocol. 

After gaining control of BSC and Polygon the hacker drained the BSC and Polygon protocol, then upgraded the contract to allow draining of all tokens that the contracts had given unlimited approval.

Most losses were on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

"The company worked with Kaspersky, who believe the hackers were the Lazarus Group with links to North Korea."
