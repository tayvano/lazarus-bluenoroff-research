## 2026-01-06 - Report #3280 - $20,000

note: may not be vscode actually

overlaps with Oxya, Seedify, etc.

> On 18th dec my friend reached out to me asking for technical help for one of the hiring interview he has coming up, he wanted to see the front end of a project to understand it, he was non-tech so asked for my help and I usually don't run 3rd part repo on my device but that time I didn’t checked the source or follow the lead correctly and ran it on my device that’s how my device got infected.
> Buried inside the code the hacker was calling some api to get code from a server and running the code with root permission inside my node environment
> Hacker probably had backdoor in my device for past 20 days, or he was writing a script to unstake all my portfolio from all defi and sweep everything in one shot
> He got access to Metamask and phantom keys from the root access I am guessing, IDK how but they got access. (not super sure on this one, have got mixed reviews on this, some security researchers may jump on this one)
> Funny thing i was not even the primary target, my friend was and i let my guard down and ran that repo (Which i would have never done if i got the DM from hacker), the mistake that costed me huge.

## 2026-01-09 - Report #3306 - $20,000

> I lost a significant amount of money due to a silent, zero-interaction dev environment exploit.
> No wallet connection.
> No signing.
> No running the app.
> Just cloning a repo and opening it in VS Code.
> Malicious .vscode/tasks.json hooks can execute automatically on folder open once you trust the workspace, hidden, background execution. This is actively abused by DPRK Interview groups.
> I work in Web3 and thought I was careful. This one is genuinely scary and unheard of for most devs.
> Please treat untrusted repos like malware. Open in restricted mode. Inspect .vscode/ before trusting anything. 🙏

## 2026-01-06 - Redasgard Report (Unknown if losses)

> When you vet enough freelancer code repositories, you develop instincts. A .vscode/tasks.json with runOn: folderOpen. A getCookie() function that fetches from a Vercel domain. An errorHandler.js with Function.constructor. These patterns don't belong in legitimate projects.
> In early January 2026, during routine vetting of a cryptocurrency project sourced via Upwork, Red Asgard's threat research team discovered all three. The contractor—using a fake identity—had embedded malware in a legitimate-looking code repository.
> What followed was a five-day investigation into active Lazarus Group infrastructure. This article documents what we found.
