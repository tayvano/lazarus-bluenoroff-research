## Details

Preliminary investigations indicate that OFN operational account wallets have been compromised.

The attacker exploited the access to claim OFN tokens from the vesting contract.

We have:

🔍 Initiated a full investigation

📞 Notified partners & law enforcement

🔧 Begun developing a recovery plan

User funds remain safe. The breach was isolated to vesting-related wallets.

We're working with security experts and auditors to assess and fix the problem.

A detailed update will follow asap.

Community safety and transparency remain our top priorities.

Thank you for your patience and continued support.
