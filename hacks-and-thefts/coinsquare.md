## Other Incidents

#### In 2018-2019, Coinsquare was accused of wash trading:

> In June, online publication Vice reported it had obtained leaked correspondence that showed the involvement of Diamond in wash trades at the exchange.

> OSC staff allege Coinsquare inflated the trading volumes on its platform through reporting ‚Äúwash‚Äù trades representing over 90 per cent of its reported trading volume between July 2018 and December 2019.

#### In 2019, 5000+ user records were stolen by skiddies/swappers:

> The hacker provided Motherboard with a version of the data stolen from Coinsquare. It includes just over 5,000 rows of users‚Äô email addresses, phone numbers, and in some cases physical addresses. The data also contains a column titled ‚Äútotal $ funded first 6 months,‚Äù which could represent the dollar amount put into a user‚Äôs Coinsquare account in that period, and whether Coinsquare marks the user as a ‚Äúhigh value client.‚Äù The data does not appear to include passwords.

> Coinsquare said the data came not from a hack of its systems, but rather a now former employee stole the information.

> ‚ÄúThe data was obtained as the result of employee theft of information contained within a client relationship database used for prospecting,‚Äù Stacey Hoisak, Coinsquare‚Äôs general counsel, told Motherboard in an email.

> Hoisak added that the company became aware of the issue about a year ago, and notified law enforcement, data protection authorities, and all known impacted users at the time. She suggested the company was not originally aware of the full extent of the breach, however; after Motherboard provided a limited set of screenshots of the data to Coinsquare so they could provide an informed statement, Hoisak characterized some of the information as ‚Äúadditional User names.‚Äù

#### In 2022, more customer information was breached:

> According to the email, the breach exposed ‚Äúcustomer names, email addresses, residential addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, device IDs, public wallet addresses, transaction history, and account balances.‚Äù Although the email was sent Friday, Coinsquare discovered the breach last week and notified customers via Twitter.
