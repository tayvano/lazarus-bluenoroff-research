## Details

The exchange BigONEexchange was exploited due to a supply chain attack and loss exceeds $27 million.

The production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control related servers was modified, enabling the attacker to withdraw funds. Notably, the private keys were not leaked.

In the early hours of July 16, BigONE detected abnormal movements involving a portion of the platformâ€™s assets. Upon investigation, it was confirmed to be the result of a third-party attack targeting our hot wallet. Below is the current progress of the situation:

All private keys remain secure. The attack path has been identified and contained, ensuring no further losses will occur.
